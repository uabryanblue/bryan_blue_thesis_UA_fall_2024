Data logger files from the 2 installed in the tropical rainforest biome at Biosphere 2

DL1 is the main logger and is a timeserver for all the other microcontrollers in the network.
DL1 folder should always have a _sys.log file while DL2 should not.

The data contained in each data logger should be the same except for timestamps in the data. Each logger clock may be off from each other, and receiving packets may delay recording by a different amount. The difference should be minimal if all is working as designed.

Files named in this fashion:
function_DL-MAC_SENSOR-MAC.log

Examples:
CLIMATE_485519DF2986_48E72952E8D2.log 	-> climate sensor _ data logger MAC _ sensor MAC ".log"
TRC_485519DF2986_48E729537E2C.log 	-> temperature relay control sensor _ data logger MAC _ sensor MAC ".log"
485519DF2986_sys.log 			-> data logger MAC _ "sys.log"
