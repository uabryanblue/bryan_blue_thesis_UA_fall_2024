# EFFECTS OF IN SITU LEAF WARMING ON NET PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO~2~ ASSIMILATION IN *THEOBROMA CACAO* L. (cacao):Â  A STUDY IN THE BIOSPHERE 2 TROPICAL RAINFOREST

## Raw Data From Experiment Content Description

### experiment_DL

*The contents from the two custom data loggers were collected weekly.*

-   The information from thermocouple readings from the three experiment treatment and control leaves and two heating pads for each experiment installation.

-   The information from the custom aspirated temperature/relative humidity/atmospheric pressure sensor installed at each experiment installation.

### LICOR

Raw LI-COR data from weekly measurements. Excel and text log files are available.

### Light_Curves

Net photosynthetic CO~2~ assimilation rates for a single cacao leaf in the Biosphere 2 tropical rainforest biome. This data was used to determine the light intensity for measurements using the LI-COR sampling device.

### TC_Calibration

2 point calibrations were performed for each thermocouple (TC) used in the heating and control device. The TCs were used to measure heating pad and leaf temperatures.

The coefficients were entered into the heating and control device's configuration file to ensure accurate readings for each experiment.
