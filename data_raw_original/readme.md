# EFFECTS OF IN SITU LEAF WARMING ON NET PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO~2~ ASSIMILATION IN *THEOBROMA CACAO* L. (cacao):Â  A STUDY IN THE BIOSPHERE 2 TROPICAL RAINFOREST

## Raw Data Content Description

### experiment_DL

*The contents from the two custom data loggers were collected weekly.*

-   The information from thermocouple readings from the three experiment treatment and control leaves and two heating pads for each experiment installation.

-   The information from the custom aspirated temperature/relative humidity/atmospheric pressure sensor installed at each experiment installation.

### LICOR

Raw LI-COR data from weekly measurements. Excel and text log files are available.

### Light_Curves

Net photosynthetic CO~2~ assimilation rates for a single cacao leaf in the Biosphere 2 tropical rainforest biome. This data was used to determine the light intensity for measurements using the LI-COR sampling device.
