# manual data step
SysObs_Date needs to map '2022-11-15' to '2023-11-22' in a Date format.  
The LI-COR date was off, but the filename has the correct value.  
  
If you open a CSV file in Excel, you MUST change the SysObs_Date column
to the proper format 'yyyy-m-d' before you save!!! It defaults to
'd/m/yyyy' which is not compatible with the code.

This may need to be done manually in  
leaf_identification.csv  
JOINED_leaf_identification.csv
