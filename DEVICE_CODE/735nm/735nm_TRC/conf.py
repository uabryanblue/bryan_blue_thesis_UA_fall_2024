# ESPNow CONFIGURATION
# peers are binary MAC addresses to send to

# All of these Values need to be contained in the DATA_LOOGER entry
#   for the others to work
# Values:
#   DATA_LOGGER - send readings to these MAC addresses in binary format
#   TIME - get date/time from this device, should only be ONE entry
#   REMOTE - data logger to register remote sensors
#   CALIBRATE - data logger to store calibration data

# key = HEATER, PIN = D0 (T1 port), GPIO 16, initial temp value = 0.0
