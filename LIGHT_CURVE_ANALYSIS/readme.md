# NET PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO<sub>2</sub> ASSIMILATION

**Visual Studio Code Project**

Data collected by researchers at Biosphere 2 for one cacao leaf has the
net photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate plotted using
Quarto.

Previous research optimal Q and the selected experiment Q (700) values
are shown with vertical lines.

## Running

Be sure the `renv` package manager is used and `renv::activate()` runs
before any scripts.

Run `cacao_light_curve.qmd` which will generate a PNG and TIFF file in
the `.figures/` folder.
